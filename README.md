Working Project Title: Bye-Bye Blemish; Pop Goes the Pimple; Dr. Pimple

The project we are proposing is a photo editor that allows you to remove pimples and other blemishes from an image. The user will be able to navigate the GUI via computer application and select the region(s) with a blemish to be blurred out. The blur functions will be designed like the “gaussian blur” function on photoshop. The user will be able to manipulate the size of the circular region they are selecting as well as the intensity of the blurring. If time permits, we will add more features, including alternative blurring functions and filters like black and white, inverted color, and sepia. From start to finish, the user will navigate to the menu, allowing them to select an image from their computer, blur wherever they feel necessary on the image, and then finally add filters if they wish. The final, modified image will be saved back onto their computer.
Tools: wxpython, tkinter, OpenCV


Risks:
How to reconcile the backend with the GUI
Work in pairs initially, then later on work altogether to make it interconnected
Image compatibility (.jpg, .png, .jpeg, .gif)
Allow for only a single file type
Convert a file into a standard type
Allow for all types 
Skin color matching
Create ranges of varying skin colors
Smooth image response to input (no lag)
Not sure yet

Ways to integrate SE principles and lessons from Project 1:
Use github/git for code sharing and Messenger for communication
The project is very scalable, starting with 1 main function to be incorporated in the software, and more features/functions added if time 
Decide on a consistent style for variable/function names before we start coding
Allow time for refactoring the code after it reaches the required functionalities
Modularizing the project in a way that allows for parts of the project to be independent. E.g. if the GUI has a problem, the backend should not need to be modified.

User Testing:
We will each share our GUI with 5 people and let them play around with it, while taking notes on the intuitiveness and likability of our overall design.
Additionally, since we are making a portrait editing software, we will use pictures of people with varying skin colors.
